# Step 1

word_list = ["ardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

# Todo - 1: Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.

# Todo - 2: Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# Todo - 3: Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.


## Looping Through the array and assign to the variable **chosen_word

for word in word_list:
    chosen_word = random.randint[word_list]

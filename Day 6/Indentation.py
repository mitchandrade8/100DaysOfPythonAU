# Breakdown of the scope of code

    # Indentation shows what code belongs to what 

# This code is in its own scope

# more complex example :

## MARK: - New Section

# def my_function():
    # if sky == "clear":
        # print("blue")
    # elif sky == "cloudy":
        # print("grey"):
    # print("hello")

# print("World")

## MARK: - Another Section:

# Spaces vs Tabs
